problem 1.11: cv accuracy for k: 3
  clf.fit() is not needed.
problem 1.12: grid search cv: 5
problem 1.13: best knn: 0
  no code

problem 2.5: 0/10
  response: c; correct: b
  explanation: In each training step, 9 of the folds are used for training, and 1 fold is used for testing.
problem 3.1: 0/10
  response: a; correct: b
  explanation: Accuracy tells us the fraction of predictions that are correct, so we want the value to be high.  What we really care about is accuracy on data we've never seen before.  The test data represents data we've never seen before so test accuracy is most important in classification problems.
problem 3.2: 0/10
  response: 18; correct: 729
  explanation: If there was one hyperparam with 3 possible values, the answer would be three.  If two such hyperparameters, the answer would be 3 * 3, or 3**2.  If six such hyperparameters, the answer is 6**2.
